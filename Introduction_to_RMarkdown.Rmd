## Assumptions

* You're familiar with the basic mechanics of R
* You have R and RStudio installed
* You have the [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html) package installed

This presentation was made using RMarkdown version `r packageVersion("rmarkdown")` running under `r R.version.string`.



## Reproducible documents

_What_ are reproducible documents?

>A reproducible document is one where any code used by the original researcher to compute an output (a graph, equation, table or statistical result) is embedded within the narrative describing the work

From the [eLife Reproducible Document Stack](https://elifesciences.org/labs/7dbeb390/reproducible-document-stack-supporting-the-next-generation-research-article#:~:text=A%20reproducible%20document%20is%20one,the%20narrative%20describing%20the%20work.)

_Why_ do we want to use reproducible documents?

* Transparency
* Reproducibility
* **THEY SAVE US TIME AND WORK**

Here we are in Word:

We have no idea where these numbers came from.


## Reproducible documents

What if I want to generate 100 formatted reports for 100 different datasets?

## RMarkdown


## Let's dive in

(Create a new document)


## Let's make it pretty

(immediately apply a theme, or something, to wow them)


## Chunks versus inline


## Graphics


## Tables



## Session info

For reproducibility, it is a good practice to add a call to `sessionInfo()` at the end of your document.
