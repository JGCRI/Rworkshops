```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(emo)  # install via devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
library(ggplot2)

iris_long <- reshape(iris, 
                     varying = c("Sepal.Length", 
                                 "Sepal.Width",
                                 "Petal.Length",
                                 "Petal.Width"), 
                     timevar = "dimension",
                     direction = "long")
iris_plot <- ggplot(iris_long, aes(x = Sepal, 
                                   y = Petal, 
                                   color = Species))
```

# Steps to a ggplot2 plot

## 4. Geoms

<img src="images-ggplot2/layers-4-geoms.png" width = "100%">

### _Now_ we can plot iris! {.tabset}

Compare the ggplot2 code to the base R code we saw earlier:

#### ggplot2

```{r iris-plot-ggplot}
ggplot(iris) + 
  # This aes() call sets up the PLOT LEVEL aesthetics
  aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species) + 
  geom_point()
```

#### base R

```{r iris-plot-base2}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, col = iris$Species)
legend(7, 4.3, 
       unique(iris$Species),
       col=1:length(iris$Species), 
       pch = 1)
```

Now the advantages of ggplot2 and the grammar-of-graphics approach start to get clear.

### Same data, different geoms {.tabset}

Geoms have different aesthetic requirements, and not every geom works with every dataset (visually or computationally): 

```{r}
# Note now the aes() call is INSIDE the ggplot() call--makes it obvious that these
# are the initial, PLOT LEVEL aesthetics
iris_plot <- ggplot(iris_long, aes(x = Sepal, 
                                   y = Petal, 
                                   color = Species))
```

#### geom_point

```{r iris-plot-point}
iris_plot + geom_point()
```

#### geom_line

```{r iris-plot-line}
iris_plot + geom_line()
```

#### geom_bin2d

```{r iris-plot-bin2d}
iris_plot + geom_bin2d()
```

#### geom_violin

```{r iris-plot-violin}
iris_plot + geom_violin()
```

#### geom_dotplot

```{r iris-plot-dotplot, error=TRUE}
iris_plot + geom_dotplot()
```


### Using multiple geoms

You can have as many geoms in a plot as you want. Later geoms are drawn
in front of earlier ones:

```{r two-geoms}
iris_plot + geom_density_2d() + geom_point()
```

### Geoms and aesthetics

Because of the _layering principle_ we discussed above, later steps and in
particular geoms override earlier ones as the plot is built up.

In particular, if you define aesthetics in geoms they override any earlier definitions _but only within that geom_:

```{r two-geoms-aesthetics}
# Note that, as before, aesthetics are mapped to variables inside an aes() call
# If we want to map an aesthetic to a constant value we do so OUTSIDE aes()
# E.g., + geom_point(color = "red")
iris_plot + geom_density_2d() + geom_point(aes(color = dimension))
```

This doesn't make much sense, but this might:

```{r two-geoms-aesthetics2}
iris_plot + 
  geom_density_2d(aes(linetype = dimension)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = dimension))
```

**What aesthetics are operative in this plot?**

* At the _plot level_, `x = Sepal`, `y = Petal`, and `color = Species`
* The plot aesthetics hold for `geom_point` but it _also_ uses `shape = dimension`
* The plot aesthetics hold for `geom_density2d` but it _also_ uses `linetype = dimension`

### Geoms that compute things {.tabset}

Some geoms don't take both `x` and `y` aesthetics; rather, they take just one and compute the other, or they transform one of the aesthetics by some computation. _How_ this happens is beyond our scope here (come back next week!) but let's look at a couple of examples.

#### geom_histogram

```{r geom_compute1}
ggplot(iris_long) +
  aes(x = Sepal) +
  geom_histogram()
```

#### geom_boxplot

```{r geom_compute2}
ggplot(iris_long) +
  aes(x = Species, y = Sepal) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

#### geom_boxplot (2)

```{r geom_compute3}
ggplot(iris_long) +
  aes(x = Species, y = Sepal) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, aes(color = dimension))
```

Notice how the final boxplot-and-point plot makes it clear that the
boxplot-only plot **is highly deceptive**: there are two groups of data here
(two dimensions that were measured), and you probably wouldn't want to present
them combined together.

Remember one of the 10 data visualization principles [above](#dataviz): **visualize your _data_, not just summaries!**


### Data-less geoms

Some geoms are handy for annotation or to help with interpretation:

```{r two-geoms-ablines}
iris_plot + 
  geom_density_2d(aes(linetype = dimension)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = dimension)) +
  # vertical line
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5, size = 3) +
  # horizontal line
  geom_hline(yintercept = 6, color = "purple", linetype = 2) +
  # a-b line
  geom_abline(size = 10, alpha = 0.25, slope = 0.3, intercept = 1)
```

There's also a useful `annotate()` function; see its documentation.


### What geom should I use?

The question here is really: *_what are you trying to communicate?_*

(See notes under Data visualization section [above](#dataviz).)

| If you want to...                                 | ...try this geom                         |
| --------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| show the relationship between two variables       | `geom_point` `geom_jitter`               |
| show values over time or a series                 | `geom_bar` `geom_line`                   |
| show data distribution (1D)                       | `geom_histogram` `geom_density`          |
| show data distribution (against another variable) | `geom_boxplot` `geom_violin`             |
| show data distribution (2D)                       | `geom_hex` `geom_bin2d`                  | 
| analyze trends                                    | `geom_smooth` `geom_line`                |


### Smoothers and models

We frequently would like to fit, or show, trend lines with point data. The
easiest way to do this is with `geom_smooth()`:

```{r iris-smooth1}
iris_plot + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

What's happened here?

* By default, `geom_smooth` uses a [loess smoother](http://r-statistics.co/Loess-Regression-With-R.html),
which is just a form
of [local regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression)
* This is noted in the diagnostic message printed by `geom_smooth` 
* `geom_smooth` inherited the plot aesthetics (x, y, color), so it fit separately to each color (group of data)

More likely, we would like a simple linear regression---i.e., trend lines. For this we just need to override the default and tell is to use R's [lm](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lm) function:

```{r iris-smooth2, message=FALSE}
iris_plot + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

We might also want to fit an _overall_ trend line, to the pooled data (i.e.,
without groups). You might be tempted in this case to override the
color aesthetic to a constant value. This works, but it's not ideal. Better:

```{r iris-smooth3, message=FALSE}
iris_plot + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +   # per-group trend line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",  
              color = "black", 
              group = 1,         # pooled; intent is clear
              linetype = 2)       
```

Behind the scenes:

* Our `color` aesthetic controls the `group` aesthetic in this plot
* `group` is ultimately what determines how the data are split up for computation and plotting
* Setting `group = 1` makes it crystal clear what we want:
a single `group` for the second `geom_smooth`.

Finally, we can use any smoothing function we want, including custom ones.

```{r iris-smooth4, message=FALSE}
ggplot(iris_long, aes(Sepal, Petal)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), color = "red")    
```

## 3. Labels

<img src="images-ggplot2/layers-3-labels.png" width = "100%">

Labeling your plots well is [important](https://xkcd.com/833/).

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/convincing.png)

As we've seen, ggplot2 takes its default axis and aesthetic labels from the columns you specify. These are easy to change using the `xlab` and `ylab` functions; the `ggtitle` function is available as well:

```{r iris-labels, message=FALSE}
iris_plot + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  xlab("What is a sepal again?") +
  ylab("Petal (cm)") +
  ggtitle("This is starting to look like a real plot!")
```


## 2. Themes

<img src="images-ggplot2/layers-2-themes.png" width = "100%">

ggplot2's theme system is powerful and sometimes confusing. Like
the rest of the ggplot system, it uses the idea of _inheritance_: you can apply themes, or aspects of them, to entire plots, sub-elements, or small details, and changes cascade down.

The simplest step is to apply a theme to an entire plot:

### Theme examples {.tabset}

#### theme_gray

```{r iris-theme1}
iris_plot + geom_point() + theme_gray()
```

#### theme_dark

```{r iris-theme4}
iris_plot + geom_point() + theme_dark()
```

#### theme_minimal

```{r iris-theme5}
iris_plot + geom_point() + theme_minimal()
```

#### theme_cowplot

_Many_ more themes are available in other R packages and online repositories:

```{r iris-theme6, message=FALSE}
library(cowplot)
iris_plot + geom_point() + theme_cowplot()
```

#### theme_economist

_Many_ more themes are available in other R packages and online repositories:

```{r iris-theme7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggthemes)
iris_plot + geom_point() + theme_economist()
```

### {-}

The theming system is also how we change specific aspects of plots.

### Theme inheritance {.tabset}

Let's say we want to apply some formatting to text in our plot. But, _which_ text?

#### All text

```{r iris-texttheme1}
iris_plot + geom_point() + ggtitle("Iris") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20, color = "red")) 
```

#### Axis text

```{r iris-texttheme2}
iris_plot + geom_point() + ggtitle("Iris") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 20, color = "red")) 
```

#### x axis text

```{r iris-texttheme3}
iris_plot + geom_point() + ggtitle("Iris") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 20, color = "red")) 
```

#### Bottom x axis text

```{r iris-texttheme4}
iris_plot + geom_point() + ggtitle("Iris") +
  theme(axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(size = 20, color = "red")) 
```

#### All titles

```{r iris-texttheme5}
iris_plot + geom_point() + ggtitle("Iris") +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 20, color = "red")) 
```

#### Axis titles

```{r iris-texttheme6}
iris_plot + geom_point() + ggtitle("Iris") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20, color = "red")) 
```

### {-}

We can do similar things with any other aspect of the plot: grid lines, legends, backgrounds, etc. From the [help page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html):

>Theme elements inherit properties from other theme elements hierarchically. For example, `axis.title.x.bottom` inherits from `axis.title.x` which inherits from `axis.title`, which in turn inherits from `text`. **All text elements inherit directly or indirectly from `text`; all lines inherit from `line`, and all rectangular objects inherit from `rect`.** This means that you can modify the appearance of multiple elements by setting a single high-level component.

**Interestingly** (I just realized this in preparing these slides) this seems to be wrong or at least incomplete? I don't understand why `axis.text` isn't inheriting from `text` (which is what the documentation says). `r emo::ji("shrug")`


## 1. Facets

<img src="images-ggplot2/layers-1-facets.png" width = "100%">

Facets are multi-panel plots that show different _subsets_ of a data frame. They work best on discrete variables and can help clear up a busy plot.

- `facet_grid` is a rigid m x n matrix and best used with multiple variables
- `facet_wrap` is a long ribbon of panels that can be **wrapped** into any number of columns using `ncol` and best used with a single variable

### Faceting examples {.tabset}

**Which of these is the best visualization? Why?**

#### None

```{r iris-facetwrap0}
iris_plot + geom_point()
```

#### by `Species`

```{r iris-facetwrap1}
iris_plot + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Species)
```

#### by `dimension`

```{r iris-facetwrap2}
iris_plot + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~dimension)
```

#### by both

```{r iris-facetwrap3}
iris_plot + geom_point() + facet_grid(Species ~ dimension)
```

### {-}

At this point, we've pretty much arrived at our final plot!

<img src="images-ggplot2/layers-final-plot.png" width = "100%">


# Accessibility {.tabset}

At a minimum, be aware that some of the default colors in ggplot2 have equal [luminance](http://www.workwithcolor.com/color-luminance-2233.htm) and so can be difficult to distinguish, particularly for colorblind viewers.

We can change colors and palettes, however; for example, the [Viridis](https://www.thinkingondata.com/something-about-viridis-library/) color scales included with ggplot2 are designed to be perceptually uniform in both color and black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.

Use `viridsd()` with discrete data, and `viridisc()` with continuous data.

The [RColorBrewer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/RColorBrewer.pdf) package is another good option worth looking into.

```{r, txhousing0, echo=FALSE}
txsamp <- subset(txhousing, city %in%
                   c("Houston", "Fort Worth", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Austin"))
tx_housing <- ggplot(data = txsamp, aes(x = sales, y = median)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = city))
```

## Default

```{r txhousing1}
tx_housing  # down-sampled from the "txhousing" dataset
```

## scale_colour_viridis_d

```{r txhousing2}
tx_housing + scale_color_viridis_d()
```


# Using and saving plots

Note that `ggplot()` objects are just like any other R object, and can be printed (displaying the plot), passed to functions, saved to disk, etc.

The primary way to save a _plot image_ is the `ggsave()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point()
print(p)
ggsave("cars_plot.pdf")

# You can specify file types and dimensions:
q <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length)) + geom_histogram()
print(q)
ggsave("iris_plot.png", width = 8, height = 5)

# By default ggsave assumes you mean "save the last plot generated"
# but you can save arbitrary objects:
ggsave("cars_plot.jpg", plot = p + theme_bw())
```

<img src="images-ggplot2/saved-plots.png" width = "75%">


# A complicated example

This figure is from a [recent paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15353) we published with many co-authors in GCB:

<img src="images-ggplot2/figure3-climate-whittaker.png" width = "100%">

This seems---and is---complex, but you now have the tools to see what's happening in the code that generates the figure.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Whittaker biome plot
library(plotbiomes)
p_inset <- whittaker_base_plot() +
  geom_point(data = cosore_points, 
             aes(x = mat_cosore, y = map_cosore / 10),
             color = "black", shape = 4) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 500)) +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7),
        legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "lines"),
        legend.position = c(0.35, 0.75),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", 
                                    fill = NA, size = 0.5))

# SP's main climate space plot
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_hex(data = map_mat_global,
           aes(x = mat, y = map / 10), 
           bins = 100, na.rm = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Grid cells", begin = 0.85, end = 0) +
  geom_point(data = cosore_points, 
             aes(x = mat_cosore, y = map_cosore / 10),
             color = "black", shape = 4, size = 1.5, na.rm = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 500)) +
  labs(x = "MAT (°C)", y = "MAP (cm)")

# Inset the first inside the second
library(cowplot, quietly = TRUE)
ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(p) +
  draw_plot(p_inset, x = 0.1, y = 0.52, width = 0.4, height = 0.45)
```

# Fancier things

This workshop has covered a lot of ground, and necessarily skipped over and/or fudged
some concepts for clarity and time.

Important things we haven't talked about include:

- **Statistical transformations**
- **Scales and coordinate systems**
- Plotting dates, maps, animations
- Swapping in new data to an existing plot 
- Combining different plots in a larger figure

Some of these are built into ggplot2, but there's also a whole
ecosystem of extension packages that people have written.
