## Day 1 goals {.build}

>- Introduce R: what it is, and why that goofy name
>- Understand a bit about R's capabilities and why people use it
>- Install R and RStudio and understand the difference between them
>- Starting RStudio and looking around
>- Do some computing in R
>- Objects: _variables_ and _functions_

## What is "R"?

>R is a **programming language and free software environment for statistical computing** and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)

>R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of [an earlier programming language called] S. The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version (v1.0) on February, 29th 2000.

## Why use it?

R offers powerful and flexible _data processing_, beautiful _graphics_, and the ability to analyze data more more quickly and reproducibly than e.g. Excel.

```{r, out.width = "67%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-windows.png")
```

## Why use it?

R is command-line software: you type and the computer (well, R) computes, displays figures...whatever you order it to do.

RStudio is a popular _interface_ for R. It sits on top of R, and it allows users to more easily (for many people) interact with and use the underlying R.

## Installation

First, R: https://cran.r-project.org

Second, RStudio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/

## Let's look around RStudio

(Using RStudio.)

In particular:
* The _console_
* The _editor_

## Do something with R

We can type calculations into the console and R will immediately respond:
```{r calculator, echo=TRUE}
1 + 1
2 * 3
(135 + 2) ^ 3
```
